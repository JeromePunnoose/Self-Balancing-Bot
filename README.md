#  Self-Balancing Robot

A two-wheel **self-balancing robot** based on the **inverted pendulum principle** using a **PID control algorithm**.

---

##  Project Overview

This robot maintains upright balance by continuously measuring tilt angle using an **MPU6050 IMU sensor** and applying a **PID controller** to adjust motor speed in real time.

The system runs a fast control loop to ensure stability and smooth correction.

---

##  Control Theory

The robot uses:

- **Proportional (P)** – Reacts to current error  
- **Integral (I)** – Corrects accumulated past error  
- **Derivative (D)** – Predicts future error  

### PID Equation

```
Output = Kp * error + Ki * sum(error) + Kd * rate_of_error
```

Where:

```
error = 0° - measured_angle
```

##  Hardware Components

- **Arduino UNO**
- **MPU6050 (Gyroscope + Accelerometer)**
- **L298N Motor Driver**
- **2 × 18650 Li-ion Batteries (7.4V nominal)**
- **DC Gear Motors**
- Buck Converter (for regulated 5V supply)

---

##  Working Principle

1. IMU measures tilt angle.
2. Current angle is compared to setpoint (0°).
3. PID controller calculates correction.
4. Motor driver adjusts wheel speed.
5. Process repeats continuously (~200–500 Hz).
